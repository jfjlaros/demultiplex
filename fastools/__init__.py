# On the event of a new release, we update the __version_info__ package
# global and set RELEASE to True.
# Before a release, a development version is denoted by a __version_info__
# ending with a 'dev' item and RELEASE is set to False.
#
# We follow a versioning scheme compatible with setuptools [1] where the
# __version_info__ variable always contains the version of the upcomming
# release (and not that of the previous release), post-fixed with a 'dev'
# item. Only in a release commit, this 'dev' item is removed (and added
# again in the next commit).
