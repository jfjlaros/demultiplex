## Table of Contents
Please read through these guidelines before you get started:

1. [Questions & Concerns](#questions--concerns)
2. [Issues & Bugs](#issues--bugs)
3. [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
4. [Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests)
5. [Code Style](#code-style)

## Questions & Concerns
If you have any questions about using or developing for this project, reach out
to @jfjlaros or send an [email][email].

## Issues & Bugs
Submit an [issue][issues] or [pull request][compare] with a fix if you find any
bugs in the project. See [below](#submitting-pull-requests) for instructions on
sending in pull requests, and be sure to reference the [code style
guide](#code-style) first!

When submitting an issue or pull request, make sure you are as detailed as
possible and fill in all answers to questions asked in the templates. For
example, an issue that simply states "X/Y/Z is not working!" will be closed.

## Feature Requests
Submit an [issue][issues] to request a new feature. Features fall into one of
two categories:

1. **Major**: Major changes should be discussed with me via [email][email]. I am
   always open to suggestions and will get back to you as soon as I can!
2. **Minor**: A minor feature can simply be added via a [pull request][compare].

## Submitting Pull Requests
Before you do anything, make sure you check the current list of [pull
requests][pull] to ensure you are not duplicating anyone's work. Then, do the
following:

1. Fork the repository and make your changes in a git branch: `git checkout -b
   my-branch base-branch`
2. Read and follow the [code style guidelines](#code-style).
3. Make sure your feature or fix does not break the project! Test thoroughly.
4. Commit your changes, and be sure to leave a detailed commit message.
5. Push your branch to your forked repo on GitHub: `git push origin my-branch`
6. [Submit a pull request][compare] and hold tight!
7. If any changes are requested by the project maintainers, make them and
   follow this process again until the changes are merged in.

## Code Style
Please follow the coding style conventions detailed below:

- For Python: [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code][pep8].
